    value: "<p>A State has two options for submitting a State Plan — a Unified State Plan or a Combined State Plan. At a minimum, a State must submit a Unified State Plan that meets the requirements described in this document and outlines a four-year strategy for the core programs. The six core programs are— </p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>the Adult Program (Title I of WIOA),</li>\r\n\t<li>the Dislocated Worker Program (Title I), </li>\r\n\t<li>the Youth Program (Title I), </li>\r\n\t<li>the Adult Education and Literacy Program (Title II), </li>\r\n\t<li>the Wagner-Peyser Act Program (Wagner-Peyser Act, as amended by title III), and </li>\r\n\t<li>the Vocational Rehabilitation Program (Title I of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended by Title IV). </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Alternatively, a State may submit a Combined State Plan that meets the requirements described in this document and outlines a four-year strategy for WIOA’s core programs plus one or more of the Combined Plan partner programs. When a State includes a Combined State Plan partner program in its Combined State Plan, it need not submit a separate plan or application for that particular program. If included, Combined State Plan partner programs are subject to the “common planning elements” (Sections II and III of this document) where specified, as well as the program-specific requirements for that program. The Combined State Plan partner programs are— </p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Career and technical education programs authorized under the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006 (20 U.S.C. 2301 et seq.) </li>\r\n\t<li>Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Program (42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) </li>\r\n\t<li>Employment and Training Programs under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Programs authorized under section 6(d)(4) of the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 (7 U.S.C. 2015(d)(4))) </li>\r\n\t<li>Work programs authorized under section 6(o) of the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 (7 U.S.C. 2015(o)) </li>\r\n\t<li>Trade Adjustment Assistance for Workers Programs (Activities authorized under chapter 2 of Title II of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2271 et seq.)) </li>\r\n\t<li>Jobs for Veterans State Grants Program (Programs authorized under 38, U.S.C. 4100 et. seq.) </li>\r\n\t<li>Unemployment Insurance Programs (Programs authorized under State unemployment compensation laws in accordance with applicable Federal law) </li>\r\n\t<li>Senior Community Service Employment Program (Programs authorized under Title V of the Older Americans Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 3056 et seq.)) </li>\r\n\t<li>Employment and training activities carried out by the Department of Housing and Urban Development </li>\r\n\t<li>Community Services Block Grant Program (Employment and training activities carried out under the Community Services Block Grant Act (42 U.S.C. 9901 et seq.))* </li>\r\n\t<li>Reintegration of Ex-Offenders Program (Programs authorized under section 212 of the Second Chance Act of 2007 (42 U.S.C. 17532)) </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>* States that elect to include employment and training activities carried out under the Community Services Block Grant (CSBG) Act (42 U.S.C. 9901 et seq.) under a Combined State Plan would submit all other required elements of a complete CSBG State Plan directly to the Federal agency that administers the program. Similarly, States that elect to include employment and training activities carried by the Department of Housing and Urban Development and programs authorized under section 6(d)(4) and 6(o) of the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 that are included would submit all other required elements of a complete State Plan for those programs directly to the Federal agency that administers the program. </p>\r\n"
